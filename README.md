Password Strength Checker
This project is a C++ console application designed to evaluate the strength of user passwords. It checks both randomly selected example passwords and passwords entered by the user, providing feedback on their security.

The program enforces password criteria such as a minimum length of 8 characters, inclusion of at least one digit, one special symbol, one uppercase letter, and one lowercase letter. If the password does not meet these requirements, it informs the user about the missing elements and prompts for a new password until a strong one is entered.

To run the application, compile the code using a C++11 (or newer) compatible compiler. After compilation, the program first displays a random example password with its strength evaluation, then asks the user to input a password to validate.

This tool is a simple and effective way to guide users towards creating stronger passwords and improving their password hygiene. The project is open source under the MIT license. Contributions are welcome via pull requests or issues.
